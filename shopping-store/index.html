            Shoes are coverings for the outer foot with sturdy soles on the
            bottom, typically made of leather that reaches no higher than the
            ankle. Shoes are meant to provide support, comfort, and protection
            for the feet. But shoes can also be worn as an item of fashion.
            Often shoes are worn over socks.
